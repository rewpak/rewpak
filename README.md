<h3 align="left">🧑🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

###

<p align="left">🎓 I’ve completed a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Brunel University London. I’m really into machine learning — especially deep learning! Love working with neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and all that good stuff. From prepping data to training and tweaking models — that’s my jam.

🚀 These days I’m exploring how to bring models into production: learning about deployment, building ML/AI pipelines, using cloud tools, and making things run smoothly and efficiently.

💡 I’m all about building real-world AI products and always excited to jump into new projects and ideas. Let’s connect and create something awesome together!<br><br>
