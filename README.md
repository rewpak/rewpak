<h3 align="left">🧑🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

###

<p align="left">I’m a Master’s graduate in Artificial Intelligence, currently living in London. I’m genuinely passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I enjoy every part of the process — from data preparation and model training to fine-tuning and evaluation. I especially love working with CNNs, DNNs, and transformers. I truly believe AI has the power to improve lives, especially in fields like healthcare.

I’m currently focused on the production side of AI — learning how to deploy models, build efficient ML pipelines, work with cloud technologies, and optimize performance. I’m excited about creating real-world AI products and always open to new ideas, collaborations, and meaningful projects.<br><br>
